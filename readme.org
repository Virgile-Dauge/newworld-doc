** Progression du joueur
As you kill monsters, complete quests, gather and craft you will gain
experience. You can level up to a maximum level cap of 60.  You can
see your current experience progress at the bottom of your screen or by
pressing “K” and viewing your character screen. You can see the
numerical values by hovering over the bar.

Upon gaining a level you will get an attribute point to spend on one
of the 5 character attributes in the game:

- Strength :: Determines melee weapon damage.
- Dexterity :: Determines ranged weapon damage, also contributes
  slightly to damage of some melee weapons such as the sword.
- Intelligence :: Increases damage of magic attacks.
- Focus :: Primary stat for healers.
- Constitution :: Increases health.



*** Attribute points
    At level 1 you start with 5 points in each of the attributes. Each time
you level you will gain additional attribute points to be spent in the
attribute of your choice. There is a total of 190 points to spend from
leveling up, not counting bonuses from items and gems. You can also gain
additional points in certain attributes through the use of jewelry and
gems that are socketed into armor and weapons.

**** Strength (STR)

Strength governs your power with melee weapons. Heavy melee weapons, such as the War Hammer, scale their damage exclusively on Strength, while lighter melee weapons like the Sword scale their damage primarily on Strength, but also slightly on Dexterity.

    - +2.5% War Hammer Damage
    - +2% Sword Damage
    - +1.5% Hatchet Damage

|      300 | Light and heavy attacks with melee weapons gain Grit, 25% chance to fully mine an ore node with a single swing          |

**** Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity governs the effectiveness with ranged weapons. Bows, Muskets, and Rapier attacks scale off a character’s Dexterity. Lighter melee weapons also see a benefit from Dexterity, but not as much as they gain from Strength.

    +0.5% Sword Damage
    +1% Hatchet Damage
    +2.4% Bow Damage
    +2.5% Musket Damage
    +?% Rapier Damage

|      300 | Ammo has +15% chance of being returned, guaranteed critical hit after a dodge roll                 |

**** Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence governs your power with magical weapons, including any magical Perks your weapons might have. Both purely magical weapons like the Fire Staff, and physical weapons with a Magical Perk (such as a Flaming Sword), grow in power based on your Intelligence Attribute.

    +2.5% Magic Weapon Damage

**** Focus (FOC)

|      300 | When mana hits zero gain 200% mana regen for 10s (60s cooldown), 10% cooldown reduction for Inn fast travel |

**** Constitution (CON)

Constitution governs your overall Health pool. The higher your Constitution, the more damage you can sustain before succumbing to your injuries.

Constitution has diminishing returns on the amount of HP granted per level the more points you put into it. It starts at 25 HP granted per attribute point, and decreases gradually until you get 21 HP per attribute. This decreased the total HP granted from Constitution slightly from 12,175 to 11,325, but increased the amount of HP players get from Constitution at a lower level.

*** Gain d'expérience
    Your character gains experience from combat by killing a mob or reduced
    xp from doing damage to the mob if someone else is fighting the mob
    along side you.

    XP in a group:

    - As long as a group (as a whole) does 15% damage to a creature,
      everyone in the group gets XP and a chance at loot.

    - Group members will have to satisfy requirements to get credit;
      performing actions such as damage, heal, block in the last 2
      minutes, and being within a certain distance of the killed
      creature. Note: Ranged characters fear not—we picked a distance
      well outside the range of normal attacks.

    - The amount of XP that is granted when an enemy is
      killed by a group is adjusted based on the number of groups and
      number of players within those groups.

    If you kill a *weaker creature* you will suffer diminishing returns
    on XP gains of *40%* for creatures *10-19 levels below* your level and
    *80% for 20+ levels below* your level.

    If an enemy is 10+ levels above your level you will not be able to
    see their level, and will see a skull icon above the creature. The
    skull icon indicates that an enemy has the following properties:
    they outright kill the player rather than leaving them at death's
    door, they have an increased perception range of +10m, and they do
    not get staggered by the player. Enemies will also gain armor buffs
    starting at 3 levels over your level and they will also gain a
    damage buff at 5 levels above your level

    While leveling you will generally want to spend your points on
    your main attribute, so if you are using melee weapons for leveling,
    raise strength exclusively and only put points in constitution if you
    have problems surviving.

*** Standing system
Another secondary form of character progression is the Standings
system, which tracks your contribution to any of the faction-owned
territories in Aeternum. All activities you do in a territory award you
with small amounts of standing points, and once you have enough to
advance a rank, you can use them to unlock special bonuses that apply
while you are in this territory.

** Équipement
*** Concepts génériques
    Les objets dans new world sont définis par deux variables principales :
    - un score :: Un meilleur item a un score plus élevé (ceci dit il
      ne fit pas forcément votre build)
            #+caption: Tiers
    | Tier | Score d'objet | Niveau de joueur requis |
    |------+---------------+-------------------------|
    | I    |          0-99 |                         |
    | II   |       100-299 |                    1-19 |
    | III  |       250-399 |                   20-39 |
    | IV   |       350-499 |                   40-59 |
    | V    |       500-600 |                      60 |
    - un niveau de rareté :: Le niveau de rareté est la somme du
      nombre de *perks* et *d'emplacement de gemmes* d'un objet.
#+caption: Niveaux de raretés
| Nom       | niveau | Couleur |
|-----------+--------+---------|
| Common    |      0 | blanc   |
| Uncommon  |      2 | vert    |
| Rare      |      3 | bleu    |
| Epic      |      4 | violet  |
| Legendary |      5 | orange  |

*** Perks
    Les perks sont des modificateurs d'objets leurs conférant divers
    bonus. Les perks des objets lâchés par les monstres sont
    aléatoires, mais il est possible de les choisir en fabricant des
    objets.

*** Armes/Classes

  Les armes remplacent les traditionnelles "classes" dans new
  world. Il est possible d'en équiper *deux simultanément* et d'en
  changer à n'importe quel moment ?

  Il y a un niveau de maîtrise pour chaque type d'arme. Le niveau de
  maîtrise d'une arme se monte en... jouant avec cette arme. Il est
  ainsi possible de monter toutes les armes en même temps, bien que
  cela ne soit pas conseillé : en étant moyen partout, on est bon
  nulle part.

*** Armures
    Il existe trois catégories d'armures :

- Light :: While wearing light armor, your dodge is a quick roll that
  covers a lot of distance. Light armor tends to be less protective,
  however you gain a 20% damage bonus while in the light armor weight
  category. The damage increase also affects your healing output.

- Normal :: While wearing normal weight armor, your dodge is a quick
  hop. This offers a good balance between protection and mobility. You
  deal 10% damage and crowd control debuffs you apply last 10% longer.
  The damage increase also affects your healing output.

- Heavy :: While wearing heavy armor, your dodge is a slow
  sidestep. Heavy armor limits your mobility but offers the best
  damage mitigation. Your block stability is increased by 15% and crowd
  control debuffs you apply last 20% longer.

La catégorie actuelle de votre armure dépend du poids total des
éléments d'armure équipés.
